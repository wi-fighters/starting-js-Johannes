# Today's exercise

## Exercise 1 (covered in class)

Write a function called `generateBandName`.

- It should accept two parameters: `clothingColour` and `lastFoodEaten`

- It should return a string that represents the resulting band name, with every first letter as a capital.

- There should be no calls to console.log() inside the function.

E.g

- With the input 'red' 'cookies', it should return 'The Red Cookies!'
- With the input 'blue' 'ciabattas', it should return 'The Blue Ciabattas!'

Between exercises, remember to run through [the recently-updated checklist](https://github.com/wi-fighters/how-to/blob/master/how-to-check-your-code.md) as you go.

## Refactor the above function so that...

0. The function only includes one return statement (you may need to add / change something else to make this work...)

1. Every time the function is called, it should store the result in a global array (and still return it like before).
