// Test your understandmving of 'hoisting':
// - can you explain why we can call getCoffee before we declare it?
// - can we use wantMilk before we declare it? why / why not?
// - how do const, let and var handle hoisting differently?

// Bonus question: when interviewers ask about const, let and var, they will also want you to mention:
// - how do const, let and var handle scope differently?

// Check this article for reference.
// The article talks about "window" which we haven't seen yet. Just think of window as the global scope.
